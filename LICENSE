 CrossMobile Community Edition is Open Source and free software. It consists
 of four parts:

 a) CrossMobile Runtime Library
 c) CrossMobile Build Tools
 d) CrossMobile Utilities
 b) CrossMobile Manager

 a) All software that is part of the application runtime, meaning the code is
    required to be redistributed in the produced target application (i.e. the
    CrossMobile Runtime Library), is under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License V3.

 b) The sources of the tools themselves that process the user provided code, in
    order to properly transform this code to be executed in the target device
    (i.e. the CrossMobile Build Tools), is under the GNU  Affero General Public
    License V3. 

 c & d) The GUI front-end of the CrossMobile program (CrossMobile Manager), as

 You are allowed to redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
 specified Licenses as declared above. Please see the corresponding license
 files for more details.

 CrossMobile comes in two flavours, Community Edition and Commercial Edition.
 Community edition is Open Source and free. The Commercial Edition needs a
 special license.

 To use the Community Edition, you should either (a) use it in a project under
 any open source compatible license or (b) use it in a company with only one
 CrossMobile developer. You are also allowed to use CrossMobile for any
 commercial purpose, as long as any of the above requirements are met. Also
 you are eligible to use CrossMobile in larger teams as long as it is for
 evaluation purposes and the produced applications are not distributed in any
 way.

 In all other cases the Commercial Edition is required. If you have any more
 questions please contact us through https://crossmobile.tech/contact
