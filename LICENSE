                           CrossMobile License


 CrossMobile comes in two flavours, Community Edition and Commercial Edition.
 Community edition is Open Source and free. The Commercial Edition needs a
 special License.

 To use the Community Edition, you should either (a) use it in a project under
 an open source license or (b) be a single developer. You are also allowed to
 use CrossMobile for any commercial purpose, as long as any of the above
 requirements are met. Also you are eligible to use CrossMobile in larger
 teams as long as it is for evaluation purposes and the produced applications
 are not distributed.

 In all other cases the Commercial Edition is required. If you have any more
 questions please contact us through https://crossmobile.tech/contact


 The Community Edition consists of four parts:

 a) CrossMobile Runtime Library
 c) CrossMobile Build Tools
 d) CrossMobile Utilities
 b) CrossMobile Manager


 a) All software that is part of the application runtime, meaning the code is
    required to be redistributed in the produced target application (i.e. the
    CrossMobile Runtime Library), is under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License V2.1.

 b) The sources of the tools themselves that process the user provided code, in
    order to properly transform this code to be executed in the target device
    (i.e. the CrossMobile Build Tools), is under the Affero General Public
    License V2. 

 c & d) The GUI front-end of the CrossMobile program (CrossMobile Manager), as
    well as all helper utilities (CrossMobile Utilities), are under the GNU
    General Public License V2.

 All licensed parts are compatible to each other, as long as they are
 redistributed as a whole and all terms of each license individually are
 followed.

 You are allowed to redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the
 specified Licenses as declared above. Please see the corresponding LICENSE.*
