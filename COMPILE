How to compile CrossMobile

Requirements:
- Mac OS and latest Xcode
- gradle version 5.*
- maven
- unzip
- nuget

In order to compile CrossMobile, Android SDK should be installed and available.
Install Android Studio or Android SDK command line tools. Define the location of
the SDK in the ANDROID_SDK environmental variable. Then you need to go to
{CrossMobileSource}/resources/bootstrap and run the bootstrap.sh script. This
script should try to run a demo android project, with all compile-time required
libraries, and if succeeded it will extract the JAR files required to compile
upon, on maven projects and install them on local maven repository.

When everything is successful you should be able to compile CrossMobile
framework yourself using the "mvn install" target on the root directory.
